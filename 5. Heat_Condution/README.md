# Heat Conduction Numerical Study README

## Overview

This repository contains the Python notebook `5. Heat_Condution.pynb` that demonstrates a numerical study of the heat conduction problem. The main focus is on solving the internal energy equation, which is a partial differential equation (PDE) that models heat conduction.

## Introduction

Heat conduction is a fundamental concept in physics, referring to the transfer of heat energy through a material due to a temperature gradient. Understanding heat conduction is crucial for many applications, such as designing heat exchangers, optimizing insulation, and modeling thermal transport in various materials.

The heat conduction problem can be mathematically described by the internal energy equation, which is a PDE that connects the temperature distribution in a material to the time rate of change of the temperature and the heat conduction properties of the material. The internal energy equation can be written as:

$$\frac{∂𝑇}{∂𝑡} = 𝐝𝐢𝐯(𝐾𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑∇𝑇)$$

where:
- 𝑇 represents the temperature distribution in the material.
- 𝑡 denotes time.
- 𝐾𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑 is the thermal conductivity of the material, which is a positive scalar constant (in isotropic materials) or a symmetric positive definite tensor (in anisotropic materials).
- ∇𝑇 represents the temperature gradient.
- 𝐝𝐢𝐯 denotes the divergence operator.

The internal energy equation is subject to boundary conditions and initial conditions that describe the specific heat conduction problem being studied. In this notebook, we focus on numerically solving the internal energy equation to study the heat conduction problem.
