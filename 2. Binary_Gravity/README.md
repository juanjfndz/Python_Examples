# Python Example: 2. Binary_Gravity

This repository contains code for simulating the motion of two objects under gravitational attraction in Python. The simulation uses the equations of motion to numerically solve for the trajectory of the objects and displays the motion as an animation.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, you will need to have Python 3 and the following Python packages installed:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy

You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal:

You can install these packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, simply run the .py file file in your terminal using the following command:

```
python 2. Binary_Gravity.py
```


This will generate an animation of the two objects' motion in your default web browser.

## Jupyter Notebook

The .ipynb notebook provides a detailed explanation of the mathematics behind the simulation, as well as an example of how to use the code to simulate different initial conditions.

To run the notebook, you will need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. If you don't already have it installed, you can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install jupyter
```


Once you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can run the notebook by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the notebook in your default web browser.
